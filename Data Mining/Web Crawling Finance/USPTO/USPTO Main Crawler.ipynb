    "Description: This is USPTO(United States Patent and Trademark Office) company information crawler. USPTO updates all company, individual, business information that requested trademark registration on their system. Appearantly, they upload data on Thursday and Friday. The website is quite valuable as they have information starting from 1973. Approximately, they have more than 2 million request data. To use automative crawling, VPN IP for United States is required for entrance. I used Nord VPN for the crawling and it was fine. For crawling, as long as the website has not been modified, the code below must be run properly if and only if it is run in an order. Moreover, environment setting must be fixed based on user's computer/server setting and location beforehead. Since the purpose of this code is to collect general information of company, business, or individual, this does not collect any detailed financial information of companies."
