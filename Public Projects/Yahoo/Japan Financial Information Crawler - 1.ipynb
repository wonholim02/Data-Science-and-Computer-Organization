    "Description: This is public company financial statement web crawling code for Yahoo finance. This crawler focuses on getting Japanese public company data. Including Japan, yahoo finance have various general/financial information of companies around the world, and has reasonable amount of information. But their server status is the worst so far, and error occurs a lot of time. For crawling, as long as the website has not been modified, the code below must be run properly if and only if it is run in an order. Moreover, environment setting must be fixed based on user's computer/server setting and location. However, one need to utilize a lot of crawlers at the same time so that those companies that are not crawled due to loading status could be searched again by another crawler. Also, full excel list of name of the companies are needed to be collected beforehead as long as this crawler uses serach engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "#### - Because of the special structure, entirely new method is used for yahoo finance crawling.\n",
    "#### 1.Get complete list (xlsx) of Japanese public company names\n",
    "#### 2.Extract each company name from the file\n",
    "#### 3.Search on yahoo finance engine using chromedriver\n",
    "#### 4.Get data that we need\n",
    "#### 5.Store as list, and write on new csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "#### Yahoo Finance has unstable server\n",
    "##### - Error occurs randomly based on loading time\n",
    "#####  Some of them cannot be solved by time sleep\n",
    "#### For Better Accuracy, we need to run crawlers as many as possible"
