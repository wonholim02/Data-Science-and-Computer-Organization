    "Description: This is public company financial statement web crawling code for SET, an official stock exchange website for Thailand. SET provides highly valuable and detailed financial information. Since the purpose of this code is to collect financial information of public company, this does not collect information of ETFs, Funds, Bonds, and other non-company type entities. If one wants to make crawler for those types of entities, entire code must be newly created for accuracy. For crawling, as long as the website has not been modified, the code below must be run properly if and only if it is run in an order. Moreover, environment setting must be fixed based on user's computer/server setting and location."
